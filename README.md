- 👋 Hi, I’m @Suzanne102
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, well that is being ambitious, more like I would like to know a little more about coding so I can converse with AI and be able to update my websites. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javaScript. After Html and Css on freeCodeCamp. Then I would like to learn python and github more, so I can clone some of the great stuff one can find to design up-to-date responsive websites. I was using an old version of Dreamweaver, it still updates my templates, I need to update that too. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on appreciating your collaborations. I have a few websites. I have an E-Commerce, on which I am really behind. www.weweimport.com. I import and sell beaded goods from Kenya. And with my husband we have a rental business, www.casatoscajavea.com, which I would like to expand with and learn how to do marketing on social medias. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... Via Email info@casatoscajavea.com
